# Houses Project

Welcome to the Houses Project repository! This project is part of our efforts to develop a platform for managing and displaying information about different houses. The goal of this project is to facilitate access to crucial information about houses available for sale or rent, including descriptive details and images.

## Main problem 

In the real estate industry, accessing accurate and comprehensive information about houses for sale or rent can be a challenging task. Buyers and renters often struggle to find reliable sources of information that provide in-depth details and high-quality images of the properties they are interested in. This lack of accessible and trustworthy information can lead to frustration, wasted time, and even poor decision-making.

## Features

- **House Information Display**: Users can search for and view comprehensive details about the available houses.
- **High-Quality Images**: The project includes high-quality images of the houses, allowing users to get a clear overview.
- **Easy Browsing**: A simple and intuitive user interface makes it easy to navigate through houses and find important information.
- **Account Management**: The platform enables users to create their own accounts to track favorite houses and more.


## User Stories
